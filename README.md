# French word2vec vectors

[word2vec vectors for French, based on the FrTenTen corpus (10 billion words)] (https://repository.ortolang.fr/api/content/frvectors/head/FrTenTen-2018-07-24 "FrTenTen vectors")

For practical reasons (the files are too big to upload to github), this repository is just a pointer to a distant repository on the French Huma-num Ortolang repository.

The vectors were obtained via Facebook's fastText tool. They are compatible with any word2vec implementation.

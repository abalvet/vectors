# French word2vec vectors

These vectors are based on the FrTenTen corpus (10 billion words). The vectors were obtained via Facebook's fastText tool. They are compatible with any word2vec implementation.

For practical reasons (the files are too big to upload to github), this repository is just a pointer to a distant repository on the French Huma-num Ortolang repository: https://repository.ortolang.fr/api/content/frvectors/head/FrTenTen-2018-07-24 "FrTenTen vectors". 

See copyright and licence restrictions.

Caveat: the files were generated by fastText, without any modification other than normalizing the input corpus. Results are better (i.e. less bad) with the vectors based on the "small" corpus sample (1 Gb of random sentences) than with the whole FrTenTen corpus.
